#### ARTIFACT 1: Software Engineering and Design
For the first artifact of this project, I chose to enhance my layout and overall design of a Weight Tracking application that I had started in a previous class. The purpose of this app is to track a user's daily weight toward their goal weight. When I started with this artifact, it did have a layout, but overall, I did not have a very good sense of direction and usability from a user-friendly standpoint. While menus were there, nothing was intuitively laid out to a point where a user would be able to easily infer how to operate the application. I first revamped my main screen, adding a toolbar to house 3 other clickable buttons. I also set a layout on the bottom of the main screen to house another button that would act as the starting point for the application. I selected this item because I thought that I could do an overall better job of having a more user-positive experience. I wanted to take elements from applications I had used in the past and implement some of the features I liked. One of the biggest features from a design standpoint was the ability to click an image rather than a button in order to transition to another screen. I think that it is a cleaner way to display the option of going to another menu or screen as an image can not only convey what the button might do, but the image can also tie in the overall look of the application. The most evident learning experience I had regarding this artifact was looks vs. usability. While something may look clean when presented on a graphic, that doesn't always constitute a direct correlation to the ability of that element to be user-friendly. I realized just how much time goes into creating simple yet usable layouts. <br>
