#### ARTIFACT 1: Software Engineering and Design
For the first articfact of this project, I chose to enchance my layout and overall design of a Weight Tracking application that I had started in a previous class. The purpose of this app is to track a users daily weight towards their goal weight. When I started with this artifact, it did have a layout, but overall I did not have a very good sense of direction and usability from a user friendly standpoint. While menus were there, nothing was intuitivley laid out to a point where a user would be able to easily infer how to opearate the application. I first revamped my main screen, adding in a toolbar that would also house 3 other clickable buttons. I also set a layout on the bottom of the main screen to house another button that would act as the starting point to the application. I selected this item because I thought that I could do an overall better job of having a more user postive experience. I wanted to take elements from applications that I had used in the past and impliment some of the features that I liked in them. One of the biggest features from a design standpoint was the ability to click an image rather than a button in order to transition to another screen. I think that it is cleaner way to display the option of going to another menu or screen as an image can not only convey what the button might do, but the image can also tie in the overall look of the application. <br>

Below is an example of the old main screen (Top) and new main screen (Bottom) in order to showcase the improved design <br>
