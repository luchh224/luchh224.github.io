## <center>CODE REVIEW<center>
A code review is one of the most important aspects of development. Code reviews are designed to identify bugs, increase code quality, and help developers learn the source code. On top of this, it is also a stage that promotes team collaboration. New ideas, suggestions, or possible solutions to problems can all be brought up during these reviews. This ensures that the direction of the project has a clear path toward success. <br>

## <center>ARTIFACTS<center>
#### ARTIFACT 1: Software Engineering and Design
For the first artifact of this project, I chose to enhance my layout and overall design of a Weight Tracking application that I had started in a previous class. The purpose of this app is to track a user's daily weight toward their goal weight. When I started with this artifact, it did have a layout, but overall, I did not have a very good sense of direction and usability from a user-friendly standpoint. While menus were there, nothing was intuitively laid out to a point where a user would be able to easily infer how to operate the application. I first revamped my main screen, adding a toolbar to house 3 other clickable buttons. I also set a layout on the bottom of the main screen to house another button that would act as the starting point for the application. I selected this item because I thought that I could do an overall better job of having a more user-positive experience. I wanted to take elements from applications I had used in the past and implement some of the features I liked. One of the biggest features from a design standpoint was the ability to click an image rather than a button in order to transition to another screen. I think that it is a cleaner way to display the option of going to another menu or screen as an image can not only convey what the button might do, but the image can also tie in the overall look of the application. The most evident learning experience I had regarding this artifact was looks vs. usability. While something may look clean when presented on a graphic, that doesn't always constitute a direct correlation to the ability of that element to be user-friendly. I realized just how much time goes into creating simple yet usable layouts. <br>

#### ARTIFACT 2: Algorithms and Data Structures
#### ARTIFACT 3: Databases
For the final artifact of the project, my goal was to create two separate databases for the weight loss application that I had started in a previous course. The first database was created in order to add user accounts to it on the register screen of the application. This screen would need to be accessed if there was no user account in the database for that particular username and password.  The second database was going to be used while in the application and needed to house the weight and date information for the user that was logged in. I decided to use two databases for this instead of one inside of another because it was easier to modify the databases as I developed them.  The hardest part about creating these databases was keeping track of all of the variables needed for all of the different methods that I created. In order to track all that was going on, I created an Excel spreadsheet that had my variables for each different Java class as well as where it would link to within the database versus the Java classes they were created for. <br>
